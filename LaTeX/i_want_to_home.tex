\maketitle

Let $\mathit{I}$ be me, $\mathit{W}$ be the objects of my willingness, and $\mathit{H}$ be home. Now we can suggest a map $\mathit{M}$, which carries its domain onto the image representing home. Since I want to go home, it is obvious that

\begin{align*}
  {I}\in{W} \, s.t. \, {M(x)}\in {H} \, \forall x \in W
\end{align*}

So let me go home.
